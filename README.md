# Horse Time



Minimal cross-platform electron app, that provides ___horse time___ when necessary.

**Prerequisites**
- **macOS** (for building macOS distributables). You can run the app on other platforms for development.
- **Node.js & npm** (tested with Node 18+). Install via Homebrew: `brew install node`.
- **horse**. A different horse, if wanted. One has been included to make your life easy.

**Run from dmg (macos)**

Download the dmg from the latest release, open the dmg and drag the horse-time app into the applications folder. 

**Run from exe (windows)**

Download the exe from the latest release, open the exe.

**Install dependencies and run (development)**

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cd <path to folder>/horse-time
npm install
```

Start the app for local testing (this opens the Electron window):

```bash
npm run start
```

Close the window or press the custom `x` button to quit horse time (you probably won't want to).
